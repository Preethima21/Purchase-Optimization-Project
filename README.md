# Purchase-Optimization-Project
Defense companies like BEML face significant challenges in optimizing their procurement processes to ensure cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize purchase decisions.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a purchase optimization model that minimizes costs while meeting the procurement requirements of a defense company.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Dummy data was used for this project due to restrictions on using proprietary data from defense companies. The data were collected from various sources and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies and prepare them for analysis.


Methodology:
The project utilized Python programming language and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The methodology involved the following steps:
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
- Feature engineering to extract relevant features for the optimization model.
- Building a machine learning model to predict optimal purchase decisions based on historical data.
- Validation and fine-tuning of the model to improve its performance.

The purchase optimization model was developed using a combination of supervised learning techniques and optimization algorithms. The model considers factors such as supplier reliability, product quality, and pricing to make optimal purchase decisions while minimizing costs.

Results and Performance Evaluation 
Purchase optimization model that recommends reorder quantities for different items based on factors such as lead time, current stock, backorder quantity, and demand forecast. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieved for the purchase optimization model is 50277.44. This low RMSE demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in streamlining BEML's procurement process, minimizing inventory holding costs, and mitigating the risk of stockouts or excessive inventory buildup.
